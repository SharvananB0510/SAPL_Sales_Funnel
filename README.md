## Problem Statement

Strent AH Pvt Limited (SAPL) has recently launched student hostels across India, providing flexible room rentals to university students and exam aspirants through their app and website. However, despite a surge in website visits and app usage during the admission season, the actual conversion rate of students joining SAPL was low (approximately 13%). To understand the reasons behind this drop, SAPL plans to analyze the stages of student acquisition in detail.

## Solution

I created a Sales Funnel Analysis for SAPL to understand the different stages of the funnel and identify the significant factors contributing most to the lower lead conversion ratio.

1. Gathered and transformed the data in Excel.
