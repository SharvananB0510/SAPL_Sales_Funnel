# SAPL_Sales_Funnel Problem Statement:

Strent AH Pvt Limited (SAPL) has recently launched student hostels across India, providing flexible room rentals to university students and exam aspirants through their app and website.

However, despite a surge in website visits and app usage during the admission season, the actual conversion rate of students joining SAPL was low (~13%). To understand the reasons behind this drop, SAPL plans to analyze the stages of student acquisition in detail.

Creating a Sales Funnel Analysis for SAPL that helps to understand the different stages of the funnel and find out the significant reason that is contributing most towards the lower lead conversion ratio
